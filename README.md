# Greenhouse_Climate_Controller
In this Greenhouse Climate controller we are using *Fuzzy logic algorithms* to set the actuators for a variable output.'

## FuZZy Logic 
* Traditional Algorithms understand only 0s and 1s but the fuzzy logic would we in between 0-1 which will increase the precision of the whole control system.
* Since, Handling Greenhouse climate is a complex task we would require such kind of algorithms to reduce the mathematical complexity of the system to work with less power.
* Fuzzy logic is an approach to computing based on "degrees of truth" rather than the usual "true or false" (1 or 0) Boolean logic on which the modern computer is based.

###[FuZZy_Logic](https://github.com/zerokol/eFLL) : This logic has been adopted by the kisted website.
